# About the project

Hi! My name is **Faranak Halali** and I am PhD student in *Clinical Nutrition*. I have never worked with R before, until last 2 weeks where I started to learn R basics in Datacamp. I am really excited for this course. I heared about the course from my supervisor and I thank her for that. Here is my GitHub repository link:
